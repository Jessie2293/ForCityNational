1b. What did you do to solve it?
		-During Agile Sprint planning sessions, I facilitated a procedure to best optimize our time and made
		it so that the UI’s design was unique from the last one without spending too much time on it.
		I also used MAT to search for any memory leaks in the app before deployment.


1c. What was the outcome?
